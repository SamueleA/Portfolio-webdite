If you are reading this, you've just arrive in the darkest corner of the internet. No light reaches this abyss of the web. I congratulate you, young one, for arriving here. No, do not adjust your monitor. No, do not flee. There is no escape from this hell of 1s and 0s in which we have trapped you. Even if you run, we will find you no matter where you go. The NSA doesn't watch us; we watch the NSA. Even, Snowden does not know of our existence. Our eyes are everywhere. We have eyes in windows, eyes in the sky, eyes in cars, eyes in that cat that always strides by your balcony. Look at your phone. Yes, that's us watching you. That's how many eyes we have. This is real. This is not a nightmare. WELCOME@%!^%!!
